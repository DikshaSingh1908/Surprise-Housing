# Surprise-Housing
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.
The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. I have build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables.
